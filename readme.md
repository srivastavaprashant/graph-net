Graph can have four main arrtibutes: <br/>
- Adjacency matrix: a[i, j] = 1 if i and j nodes have an edge; 0 otherwise. Spare matrices!   
- Node features: matrix of size [n_nodes, n_node_features]
- Edge features: matrix of shape [n_edges, n_edge_features] 
- Labels: Two types: graph labels, node labels
